Answer:
 Hi, I am Renas as you can see in my resume. I have been in IT industry more than blah blah years. I have exprecience in 3 different layers of the software application. My programing language is JAVA.
Front End (UI) I use Java and Selenium web driver
Backend (API): For Manual purpose, I use Postman and for automation, I use Rest Assured libraries.
DataBase: Manual purpose, I use MySQL(you only do relational database) and for automation, I use JDBC(Java Database connectivity)
For project management and dependency centralizitaion I use MAVEN
For Bug tracking and and management, i use JIRA
 for version control I use Github, Bitbucket, Gitlab (only say one of them)
  For CI/CD I use Jenkins
  I have experience of working in Agile env. and I am familiar with all Scrum meetings.
  As far as personality concern, I describe myself, detail oriented, cross functional team player and great communicator
In my free time, I love to travel, cook and running. That pretty much about me.

Disadvantage of Selenium: 1. We can not automate picture with selenium
                          2. We can not automate capctha
