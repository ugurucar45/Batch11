    Today Agenda
1. Soft skills Channel +
2. STLC
3. Testing Tehniques
STLC
STLC(Software Testing Life Cycle) is part of the SDLC
Its all about Testing.
1. Req. Analysis
2. Test Planning
3. Test Case development
4. Test Env. set up
5. Test execution
6. Test closure
RTM: Req. Traxcibility Matrix: 	It is type of document that map all the requirements.
Note: When it comes to testing, there are two imp. points that we need to keep in our mind.
1. User Requirements
2.Acceptance Criterias.
Because without UR and AC, WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO TEST ANYTHING SUCCESFULLY.
ENTRY CRITERIA:Gives the prerequisite itmes that must be completed before testing started.
EXIT CRITERIA: Defines the items that must be completed efore testingcan be concluded.(making sure all the tests are passed, covered all the tests)
TEST STRATEGY: it is a document that written by QA Architech. It's written only once and whole company test(plan) will be based on that
TEST PLAN: It is a document that written by QA Lead or Sr. QA. it' s written based on Test Strategy.
Every test executing should happen based on Test plan.
VERIFICATION VS VALIDATION
Verification: it is review, walkthrough and static testing. There is no code execution happening.
Validation: It's where the code implementation happens. it is dynamic testing.
Note: we can not do validation before doing verification.
BUG LIFE CYCLE
When we find a bug in software, we need to follow BUG LIFE CYCLE!
1. Reproduce the bug(ss, video)
2. create a bug ticket
3. Assigned to Dev(Developer)
4. Dev will open the ticket
4.1 either dev can say this is duplicate or This is not a bug
4.2 yes this is a bug
5. dev will fix the bug
6. tester will test the bug ticket one more time.(sanity testing)
7. if its fixed, then we will close(ticket) it.
WHAT IS JIRA?
It is a bug tracking tool that help companies to manage their project workflow and bug.
ERROR,
        BUG,
                FAILURE
Error: Human mistake( we can not avoid error)
Bug: Defect, mismatch( this is the part that Tester needs to handle)
Failure: Result of bug.
Failure means, the product is in the market with a bug
 No one wants to have a failure
 Hotfix: When we find a bug in production, We need to fix this bug rigth away without any documentation
 SEVERITY VS PRIORITY
 Severity is the state or quality of being severe. it means how bad is the bug
 Severity level defined by TESTER
 Priority is how important is this bug for company and how soon it needs be fixed. Priority level defined by PRODUCT OWNER(PO)
 HOMEWORK
 Please send me an example of different severity level and different priority level bug example.
High Severity- High Priorty
High Sverity- Low Priority
High Priority- Low Severity
Low Priority- Low Severity
Interview Question: Can you give me bug scenario for High Sverity- Low Priority?
Interview Question: Who decides the lever bug severity and priority?
