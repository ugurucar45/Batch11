    POSSIBLE INTERVIEW QUESTION:
    1)What is the difference beetewen Array and ArrayList

    ARRAY:
    *1)Array has fixed size
    2)Arrays store object and primitive data
    *3)Array doesn't have methods and it has length
    4)Array has multidimensional form
    5)The synthax of Array is int[] array= new int[];
                              int[] array= {1,2,3}

    ARRAYLIST:
    1)ArrayList is flexible size.
    2)ArrayList stores only objects.
    3)ArrayList has methods(like add, replace,remove) + it has size instead of length
    4)ArrayList doesn't have the multidimensional form
    5)The synthax is ArrayList<Integer> list = new ArrayList();
