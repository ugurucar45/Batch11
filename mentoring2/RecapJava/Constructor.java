    INTERVIEW QUESTIONS
    1)What is constructor and what do you do with it?
        ** Constructor is a way to initialize the instance variables.
        **Assign the values to the new object.

    2)Can you tell me the difference between constructor and method?
    CONSTRUCTOR:
    *doesn't have return type
    *must have same name of the class
    METHODS:
    *it will has return types
    *Methods might have or not same name of the class.

    3)Can you make the constructor private?
       SIR/MADAM you can not make the constructor not only PRIVATE also STATIC, FINAL and ABSTRACT.
       *****BUT IN MY TESTING I AM USING SINGLETON PATTER DESIGN WHICH IS A SPECIAL CLASS LIMIT PEOPLE TO ACCESS YOUR DATA.


    4)What is the difference between this,this(),super,super().
        this    -->this keywords in java refers to instance variables and methods.
        this()  -->To call another constructor in the SAME CLASS.
        *it has to be in the first line of the code.
        super   -->super means refers to parent instance variables
        super() -->to call the constructor from PARENT CLASS.
